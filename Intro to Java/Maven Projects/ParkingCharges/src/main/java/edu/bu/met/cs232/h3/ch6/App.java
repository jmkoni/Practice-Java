 * 6.8
 * Created by Jennifer Konikowski on 2/15/16.
 *
 * A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours.
 * The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof
 * in excess of three hours.The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00.
 * Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. Write an application
 * that calculates and displays the parking charges for each customer who parked in the
 * garage yesterday. You should enter the hours parked for each customer. The program
 * should display the charge for the current customer and should calculate and display
 * the running total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. It should use the method calculateCharges
 * to determine the charge for each customer.
